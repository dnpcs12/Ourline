# Game Rules

<p>Each player can choose either red or blue light.</p>
<p>The color of the line connecting two players will depend on their chosen light color.</p>
<li>Red + Red -> Red </li>
<li>Blue + Blue -> Blue </li>
<li>Red + Blue -> Purple </li>
<br>
Create lines of the same color to eliminate approaching lights.
<br>However, white lights should be left alone.
<br>There are four colors of approaching lights: red, blue, purple, and white.
